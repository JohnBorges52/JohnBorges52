#### I am a Web Developer in development
I am Brazilian and for a long time, I have wanted to become a developer. After moving to Canada, I decided to really dive into this area and enrolled in a Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs. After that every single day I have been coding and become more in love with learning new things and bringing ideas to life.

 ðŸŽ“ I have a bachelor's in Business Administration and previously was working for Brazil's Government  as a public servant. I also had a ðŸ“¸ wedding [photography company](https://www.instagram.com/morada14/) in the past which I decided to close when the pandemic hit, now I only take pictures as a hobby.
